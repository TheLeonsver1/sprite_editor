# EasyTile

This is a WIP tileset and sprite editor, Meant to be easier to use.

## Motivation

I do not like the current paid program I use to make tilesets and I want there to be a free and open source tileset editor that is easy to use, and is fast.

## How it is written

This program is written in Rust with the Bevy game engine.
